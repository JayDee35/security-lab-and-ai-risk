# security-lab-and-ai-risk

## What I'm building
A Raspberry Pi 5 headless home security/telemetry lab on a TELUS network:
- Pi-hole (DNS filtering + visibility)
- Tailscale (secure remote access without port forwarding)
- Logging + basic detections
- microSD for OS, external SSD for logs/data

## Weekly goal
4–8 hours/week using a weekly system:
- Learn (course modules + notes)
- Build (Pi lab milestone)
- Proof (ship one artifact)
- Market (one opportunity brief)
